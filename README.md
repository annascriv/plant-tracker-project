<h1>About the Project</h1>
<p>Bloom Buddy was created as a personal project for Code Platoon. It is a full stack application that allows users to create an account through Token Authentication, complete with a profile picture and bio. Users can discover new plants, read more about their specific details, and save their plant to a garden. Users also have the option to create a new plant from scratch. Once a plant is in a user's garden, they are able to track the last time it was watered or fertilized, and update the plant's information at any time. See the architectual diagram below for more details on the layout of the project and third-party APIS used. </p>
